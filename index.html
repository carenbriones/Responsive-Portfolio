      <p>My name is Caren Briones, and I am a 22 (almost 23) year old from Chula Vista, California. I attended
        California State University Long Beach for four years, and graduated in May of 2018 with a Bachelor’s Degree in
        Computer Science. For two of those years, I was a TA for Intro to Java and Intro to Python classes at CSULB.</p>
      <p>I currently work part time at 85° C Bakery in National City, so while I fulfill my childhood dreams of being a
        cake decorator, I am pursuing my new dreams of being a Web Developer. In my spare time, I like to sing, play
        guitar, and cook. I am the youngest of three siblings, and I have an 8 year old Chihuahua/Terrier named Bruno.
